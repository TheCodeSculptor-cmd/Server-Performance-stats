Project Overview
The System Stats Overview project is a shell script that provides a quick and detailed snapshot of key performance statistics of a Linux server. This tool can be useful for monitoring server health and performance by gathering information such as CPU usage, memory consumption, disk usage, and more.

The project aims to help system administrators and developers easily analyze and debug server performance using real-time data.

CPU Usage: Displays the total CPU usage by calculating the percentage of CPU actively being used.
Memory Usage: Shows both free and used memory (in MB), along with the percentage of memory used.
Disk Usage: Reports the total, used, and available disk space, as well as the percentage of disk space used.
Top 5 Processes by CPU Usage: Lists the 5 most resource-intensive processes in terms of CPU usage.
Top 5 Processes by Memory Usage: Lists the 5 most resource-intensive processes in terms of memory usage.
